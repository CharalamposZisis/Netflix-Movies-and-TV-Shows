# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows

✈️ My findings on the key concepts I've been researching are quite interesting—some were unexpected, while others were more predictable.

✅  The United States offers 41 different categories for TV shows and movies, in contrast to Malta and Azerbaijan, which each have only one.

    For example based on 2021 netflix produced 993 TV Shows which is 488 more than movies.
